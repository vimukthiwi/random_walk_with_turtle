# Random Line Drawing Turtle

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a random series of lines. Each line is drawn in a random color and direction, creating an abstract geometric pattern.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (usually included in standard Python installations)

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply clone the repository to your local machine and run the `main.py` file.

## Usage

Run the `main.py` file using Python to see the turtle draw the random lines. The program will continue drawing until you close the window.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Customization

You can customize the number of lines drawn by changing the `num_sides` variable in the `main.py` file. You can also modify the speed of the drawing by adjusting the `speed` method in the `initialize_turtle` function.
